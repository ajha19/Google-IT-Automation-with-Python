# Google-IT-Automation-with-Python

#The first-ever Professional Certificate! For the past month, I have been doing a six-course professional program in Automation with Python offered by Google, to get an in-depth knowledge of troubleshooting & debugging, version control, configuration management, and python programming. I am more than glad to share with you that I have finally completed the program. For anyone interested in automating tasks with python with no prior knowledge, I would absolutely recommend to take on this well designed course.

This course is designed to teach you the foundations in order to write simple programs in Python using the most common structures. No previous exposure to programming is needed. By the end of this course, you'll understand the benefits of programming in IT roles; be able to write simple programs using Python; figure out how the building blocks of programming fit together; and combine all of this knowledge to solve a complex programming problem.   We'll start off by diving into the basics of writing a computer program. Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with programming concepts through interactive exercises and real-world examples. You’ll quickly start to see how computers can perform a multitude of tasks — you just have to write code that tells them what to do.
